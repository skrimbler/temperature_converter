## 1  Description

This app is designed to convert temperatures from Celcius into Kelvin and Farenheit.
The input of the values can come from different locations. From the CLI, a textfile or a (fake) URL.

The output of the converted temperature can be shown as text, JSON or HTML.
Next to that, the application must be built memory-efficient.
